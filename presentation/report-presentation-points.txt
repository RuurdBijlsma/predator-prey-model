questions
why is N so high
do I need to do flocking?
do I need to do target locking?
Did i do it right? (90 - heading, atan)
Should I also model the predators decision in which prey to go for? I might be able to think of a different strategy. (Right now we chase based on distance, dragonflies do it based on speed across fov (higher speed means closer prey))
